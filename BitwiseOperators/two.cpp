// Left Shift (<<):

// Left shifting a number by n positions is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2^n.
// Mathematically, if x is the number and n is the number of positions to shift left, then x << n is equivalent to x * (2^n).

// Right Shift (>>):

// Right shifting a number by n positions is equivalent to dividing the number by 2^n and truncating any remainder.
// Mathematically, if x is the number and n is the number of positions to shift right, then x >> n is equivalent to x / (2^n).
